## üìù Content Overview:

### What is Discrete Mathematics (DM)?
A combination of **mathematics** and **computer science** concepts crucial to understanding computational theories and logical problem-solving.

---

## üî¢ Set Theory:

- **Set**: A collection of well-defined objects.
  - Denoted by uppercase letters (A, B, C...), elements by lowercase (a, b, c...).
  - Example: A = {1, 2, 3}

### Types of Sets:
- **Empty Set (‚àÖ)**: Contains no elements.
- **Universal Set (U)**: Contains all elements under discussion.
- **Singleton Set**: A set with only one element.
- **Finite Set**: Set where elements can be counted.
- **Infinite Set**: Set where counting does not end.

### Cardinality:
- The number of elements in a set.
  - Notation: |A| = n(A)

## üí° Logic:

### Propositional Logic:
- **Negation (¬¨P)**: The opposite of a proposition.
- **Conjunction (P ‚àß Q)**: True if both P and Q are true.
- **Disjunction (P ‚à® Q)**: True if at least one of P or Q is true.

### Conditional Statements:
- **Implication (P ‚Üí Q)**: If P is true, then Q must also be true.
- **Biconditional (P ‚Üî Q)**: True if P and Q have the same truth value.

### Tautology, Contradiction, Contingency:
- **Tautology**: Always true.
- **Contradiction**: Always false.
- **Contingency**: Sometimes true, sometimes false.

---

## üîó Set Operations:

- **Union (A ‚à™ B)**: All elements in A, B, or both.
- **Intersection (A ‚à© B)**: Common elements between A and B.
- **Difference (A - B)**: Elements in A but not in B.

### Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion:
- Helps calculate the size of the union of sets by avoiding double-counting.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Practice Questions:

- Solve set operations using examples.
- Prove propositions using logic identities and truth tables.
